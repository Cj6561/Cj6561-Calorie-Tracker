Just a Calorie tracking app that I use for myself. Not the greatest but it has all the features I wanted from other paid apps.
Right now I can track my Calories (increasing as I burn them), protein, fat, carb, and water intake, and compare these values to daily goals.
The daily goals can also be updated and changed depending on your diet.
Theres some navigation so you can see the previous days calories, protein, etc. Theres also a home button that returns you to the current day incase you move far back.

The app does ping homekit to see how many calories you've currently burned throughout the day. This is the only data the app asks from the user.

I've also added in sam - mode, which calculates your calories based on the macro nutrients that you've consumed only. So 9 calories for fats, and 4 for carbs and protein.
I don't use this one too often so I haven't tested it too much but I know some people do like this kind of feature in other calorie tracking apps.

To change the daily goals, you navigate to the settings menu in the top right and enter you new goals. You do not have to re-enter a goal that isn't changing.

I don't have a total understanging on how everything works yet, I've been learing as I go along, but there has been alot of googleing.
Also unsure about how to write tests for this yet but I'm looking into that.

I also have only have one collection for my firebase persistance, so all the values would be shared across any app running. This is nice for me but bad if I wanted other users to use my app.
