Just a calorie tracking app that I use for myself. Not the greatest but it has all the features I wanted from other paid apps.

I don't have a total understanging on how everything works yet, I've been learing as I go along, but there has been alot of googleing.

I also have no idea how the firebase stuff works, I assume that if someone else download the app or if I ran it on another machine it would be accesing the same data so everyone would be seeing my calorie inputs lol.

Right now the calorie and macro goals are hard coded and set for myself, so if/when I change my diet or if I wanted to share the app with someone else, thoes values would have to change.
